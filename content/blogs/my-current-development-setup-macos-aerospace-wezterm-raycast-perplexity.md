This is a concise snapshot of my current development setup and a note on what I’m still exploring.

## Platform
- macOS as the daily driver.
- Tiling window manager: **Aerospace** — lightweight, keyboard-first tiling that fits macOS well.
- Terminal: **WezTerm** — GPU-accelerated, great font rendering, and Lua-configurable.

## Productivity & search
- **Raycast** as a Spotlight alternative. I use it for quick app switching, scripts, and its AI features for small drafts and summarization.
- **Perplexity** is my primary search engine for research and deep dives. I prefer its synthesis and citation flow over conventional search.

## Development
- **JetBrains IDEs** for most work (language-specific IDEs as needed). Repositories are hosted on **GitHub** and **SourceHut**.

## AI coding assistance (in flux)
- I’m currently evaluating alternatives for AI coding because JetBrains changed their AI quota in a way that doesn’t work for me. This is an open item; I’m testing options and haven’t settled on a replacement yet.

## Why this stack works
- Keyboard-centric workflow (Aerospace + Raycast commands) keeps context switches minimal.
- WezTerm’s performance and configurability pair well with heavier IDE sessions.
- Perplexity helps compress research time with useful summaries and references.

I’ll update this post once I choose a sustainable AI coding assistant that matches my usage patterns.
